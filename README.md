An extension for Visual Studio Code that visualizes SCXML state charts, and provides the ability to visually adjust the state chart.


## Features

* Default visual style matches the current VS Code theme.
  * Customization of state and transition colors allows for additional information.
* Visual changes are stored in a custom namespace that does not affect SCXML operation.
* Support for `state`, `parallel`, `history`, and `final` nodes.
* Powerful routing of transitions via waypoints
